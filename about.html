            Welcome to PokéVault – your ultimate destination for everything
            Pokémon TCG!
          </h2>
          <p>
            We are a passionate team of collectors, traders, and longtime
            Pokémon fans dedicated to building a thriving online space for
            Pokémon card enthusiasts around the world. Whether you’re just
            starting your collection, hunting for that elusive holo, or
            showcasing your rarest gems, PokéVault is here to support every step
            of your journey. Like many of you, we fell in love with Pokémon as
            kids—opening booster packs, trading with friends, and dreaming of
            completing the Pokédex. That nostalgia turned into a lifelong hobby.
            PokéVault was born from the idea that collecting should be fun,
            organized, and accessible to everyone, no matter where they are on
            their Pokémon journey.
